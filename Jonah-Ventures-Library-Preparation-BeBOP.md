## BACKGROUND

### Summary

This protocol is used by [Jonah Ventures](https://jonahventures.com/) to prepare next-generation amplicon/metabarcoding sequencing libraries from  NOAA PMEL OME PCR1 products. PCR plates are first cleaned using either the Zymo ZR-96 DNA Clean-Up Kit or Exo1/SAP, then barcoded using unique, sample-specific Illumina Nextera Unique Dual Indices (2x 10bp) or 12-nucleotide index sequence, pooled using mag-bind normalization or the SequalPrep Normalization kit (cat#A10510-01), and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 using the SP Reagent Kit v1.5 (500 cycles) (cat# 20028402). Importantly, this standard two-step PCR sequencing library preparation methodology allows for the reuse of indices across multiple markers per sample, enabling 4 plates x 96 samples x 5-8 markers = 1,920-3,071 total libraries with far greater than 100K sequence read depth.

This protocol has been used over multiple years and has evolved over time. There are two variations of the PCR amplicon cleanup, and the PCR normal pool is indicated as option A or B in the protocols and Table of Protocol variations for each OME barcode and sequencing run included below.

### Method description and rationale

Advantages to this protocol include ease of use, leveraging commercially available Illumina sequencing kits and indices, as well as the ability to sequence across the tree of life with a multi-marker approach with up to 384 samples x 8 markers simultaneously. This protocol's steps include: _PCR Amplicon Cleanup_, _Barcoding/Indexing PCR_, _PCR Normalization and Pooling_, and _Sequencing_. 
NOAA PMEL OME conducts eDNA sample collection, filtration, extraction, and PCR1 amplification before this protocol (See our NOAA PMEL OME [Methods](https://zenodo.org/communities/noaa_ome)). Plates of PCR1 product are shipped on dry ice to Jonah Ventures in Boulder, CO, USA, where they are processed using this protocol by the sequencing company. PCR1 product is first cleaned to remove excess primers and dNTPs using either option A) an Exo1/SAP cleanup protocol or option B) Zymo ZR-96 DNA Clean-Up Kit (4 x 96 Preps.) (cat#D4018) (Zymo, Irvine, CA). Cleaned PCR1 product is then indexed through a second barcoding PCR step using Illumina Nextera UDI indices. Indexed PCR2 product is then normalized using option A) mag-bind normalization or option B) SequalPrep Normalization Plates (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and then pooled by even volume (and concentration) into a final pooled library. The library is then sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at the Texas A&M Agrilife Genomics and Bioinformatics Sequencing Core using the SP Reagent Kit v1.5 (500 cycles). The sequencing core demultiplexes raw sequence data. And downstream bioinformatics is conducted via [REVAMP](https://github.com/McAllister-NOAA/REVAMP).

This protocol is less detailed than our typical protocols, as we do not conduct this protocol ourselves. However, we capture the necessary [FAIRe](https://fair-edna.github.io/) relevant information.

### Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

This protocol can be used for library preparation of any marker gene region of any eDNA or bulk biological sample.

## PERSONNEL REQUIRED

One person with molecular biology experience.

### Safety

There are no hazardous chemicals or materials involved in this protocol. Standard lab safety techniques should still be used such as wearing PPE to avoid skin or eye contact.

### Training requirements

Molecular biology training (including, at a minimum, sterile technique, pipetting small volumes, and programming and running PCR thermocyclers) is required to conduct this protocol.

### Time needed to execute the procedure

This protocol takes about 4-5 hours to execute per plate. There is a safe-stopping point after the PCR Amplicon Cleanup, Indexing PCR, Normalization, and Pooling steps. Across all stopping points, the plate can be stored for up to a week at 4Â°C, with storage at -20ËC for up to 6 months.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Protocol

#### Preparation

1. Sterilize workspaces and durable equipment, including pipettes within the BSC, with 10% bleach. Then wipe down all surfaces and equipment with 70% EtOH.
2. If you have a UV crosslinker available, UV pipettes and tube racks regularly for 2 minutes. 
3. Run the UV light in the BSC for 30 minutes before starting work.
4. Label all PCR plates both on the side of the plate and on the top of the foil (in the plate margins). Recommended labeling scheme includes plate name, primer, date of PCR, and personnel initials.

#### PCR1 Cleanup 

##### Option A)

PCR1 products were first cleaned by incubating amplicons with Exo1/SAP following the manufacturer's instructions:
1. Remove ExoSAP-ITâ¢ reagent from the â20Â°C freezer and keep on ice throughout this procedure.
2. Mix 5 Î¼L of a post-PCR reaction product with 2 Î¼L of ExoSAPITâ¢ reagent for a combined 7 Î¼L reaction volume.
When treating PCR1 product volumes greater than 5 Î¼L, simply increase the amount of ExoSAP-ITâ¢ reagent proportionally.
3. Incubate at 37Â°C for 30 minutes to degrade remaining primers and nucleotides.
4. Incubate at 95Â°C for 5 minutes to inactivate ExoSAP-ITâ¢ reagent.
5. Product is stored at -20C.

##### Option B)

PCR1 products were first cleaned by incubating amplicons with Zymo ZR-96 DNA Clean-Up Kit following the manufacturer's instructions:
1. Add 96 ml 100% ethanol (104 ml 95% ethanol) to the 24 ml DNA Wash Buffer concentrate. Add 192 ml 100% ethanol (208 ml 95% ethanol) to the 48 ml DNA Wash Buffer concentrate.
2. In a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, add 25 Î¼L volumes of DNA Binding Buffer to each 5 Î¼L volume of PCR product. Mix briefly by vortexing.
3. Transfer sample mixtures to the wells of a Silicon-Aâ¢ Plate mounted onto a Collection Plate.
4. Centrifuge at â¥ 3,000 x g (5,000 x g max.) for 5 minutes until sample mixtures have been completely filtered. Discard the flow-through.
5. Add 300 Âµl DNA Wash Buffer to each well of the Silicon-Aâ¢ Plate. Centrifuge at â¥ 3,000 x g for 5 minutes. Repeat wash step.
6. Add 30-40 Âµl water directly to the column matrix in each well. Transfer the Silicon-Aâ¢ Plate onto an Elution Plate and centrifuge at â¥ 3,000 x g for 3 minutes to elute the DNA.
7. Product is stored at -20C.

##### Quality control
No quality control is conducted.

#### Barcoding/Indexing PCR

1. The indexing PCR (PCR2) included Promega Master mix, 0.5 ÂµM of each Illumina Nextera UDI primer, and 2 Âµl of template DNA (cleaned amplicon from the first PCR reaction) for a total volume of 25 ÂµL
2.  Thermocycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation of 95 Â°C for 3 minutes, followed by 8 cycles of  95 Â°C for 30 sec, 55 Â°C for 30 seconds, and 72 Â°C for 30 seconds. 

**Primer Sequences Used**: Illumina Nextera UDI primer sequences

| PCR Primer Name | Direction | Sequence (5â -> 3â)|
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Illumina-Nextera-UDI-PCR-F Index 1 (i7) Adapters | forward | CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-[**i7**]-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGG |
| Illumina-Nextera-UDI-PCR-R Index 2 (i5) Adapters| reverse | AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-[**i5**]-TCGTCGGCAGCGTC|

**Reaction Mixture**: PCR reagents, volumes, initial and final concentrations

| Reagent |Volume (Î¼L) per plate| Volume (Î¼L) per reaction | Intial concentration| Final concentration|
| ----- | ----- | ----- |----- |----- |
| Promega Master mix |1300| 12.5 |100% |50% |
| Forward Primer |104| 1 |10 Î¼M |0.5 Î¼M |
| Reverse Primer |104| 1 |10 Î¼M | 0.5 Î¼M |
| Nuclease-Free Water |884|8.5 | N/A|N/A |
| Template DNA|N/A| 2 | 100%|8% |
| **Total**|**2392**| **25** | **N/A** |**N/A**|

This table breaks down the mixture per plate and per reaction. When running full plates (96-wells), each reagent volume was multiplied by 104 (96+8 extra sample volumes to account for pipetting error) when preparing the final master mix.

**PCR Cycling Program**: 

| PCR step | Temperature | Duration | Repetition |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|Initial denaturation|	95Â°C	|3min|	1X|
|**Normal Cycling**||||
|Denaturation|	95Â°C|	30s|	8X|
|Annealing|	55Â°C|	30s	|8X|
|Extension 	|72Â°C	|30s	|8X|
|Hold	|4Â°C	|â	|1X|

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

*Note: When possible, PCR set-up should be carried out in a separate pre-PCR space that is distinct from where the post-PCR space where thermocyclers are located, and all post-PCR processing is performed. No equipment, consumables, or reagents should be shared between pre- and post-PCR spaces with a unidirectional flow of sample processing. This step is post-PCR and thus should occur in the post-PCR spaces.*

1. Set out Illumina Nextera UDI primers and samples to thaw.
2. Vortex and spin down thawed samples, primers, and nuclease-free water. Then tap/flick Promega Master Mix rather than vortexing before spinning down. Thawed reagents should be stored in a cooling block or fridge when not in use.
3. Pool reagents to make the final master mix, as denoted above in the reagent mixture table.
4. Set out the template DNA to thaw if frozen.
5. Aliquot 23 Î¼L of final master mix into each well of the PCR plate. The plate should sit in a cold block to ensure the reagents remain at a low temperature.
6. Add 2 Î¼L DNA template to each well
8. Seal the PCR plate with foil.
9. Spin down the plate, and then transport in cooler blocks before placing in the thermocycler.
10.  Run thermocycler protocol.

##### Quality control
No quality control is conducted.

#### PCR Normalization and Pooling 

##### PCR Normalization

Option A)

1. A 15Âµl aliquot of PCR amplicon was purified and normalized using Cytiva SpeedBead magnetic carboxylate modified particles (#45152105050250).

2. Samples were then pooled together by adding 5Âµl of each normalized sample to the pool.

Option B) 

1. A 15Âµl aliquot of PCR amplicon was purified and normalized using SequalPrep Normalization kit (cat#A10510-01).

2. Samples were then pooled together by adding 5Âµl of each normalized sample to the pool.

#### Sequencing

1. Sample library pools were sent for sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (San Diego, CA) at the Texas A&M Agrilife Genomics and Bioinformatics Sequencing Core facility using the SP Reagent Kit v1.5 (500 cycles) (cat# 20028402).

##### Quality Control
Necessary quality control measures were performed at the sequencing center before sequencing.

### Basic troubleshooting guide

- Use a unique index for each sample. Multiple different markers (e.g. MiFish Teleost 12S, 16S Universal Parada, Leray CO1) from different PCRs can be pooled together for sequencing. Similar markers (e.g. MiFish Elasmobranch 12S and Teleost 12S) will be difficult to disentangle bioinformatically.
